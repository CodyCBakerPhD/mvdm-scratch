# When dealing with uncleaned manifests...

Subsets of `all_sessions.txt`:
- `good_localizer_sessions.txt`
- `good_theta_other_sessions.txt`
- `novel_sessions.txt` 

There is some overlap between `all_session.txt` and all other collections.

Subsets of `standard_sessions.txt`:
- `good_theta_standard_sessions.txt` (which standard sessions only has one additional session of)

Then `repeat_catch_sessions.txt` is mostly but not completely non-overlapping.

These three together comprise all unique paths.

Note that 'good_theta_standard_sessions.txt' has many paths starting with a space which must be cleaned.



# When dealing with cleaned manifests...

All except `repeat_catch_sessions.txt` are subset of `all_sessions.txt`
